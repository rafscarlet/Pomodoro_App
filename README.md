The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late
1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally
25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a "pomodoro",
from the Italian word for "tomato", after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that
Cirillo used as a university student. The method is claimed to increase productivity and
focus. It has been described as a time management method and as a motivational technique.
